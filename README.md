## 📖 **Function Descriptions**

### 🔑 **Script Automation Core**
The beating heart of Blum. Accepts natural language, command-line, or API-driven routines, turning them into powerful cross-platform actions. Example:  
“Every morning at 8 am, open my calendar, check weather via Claude, and email the summary.”

### 🌐 **Multi-API Connectivity**
Talk to OpenAI, Claude, and even proprietary cloud services — use AI to create, correct, or summarize content, or automate decisions based on real-time results.  
*Real-world use:*  
“Generate a Q2 sales summary and draft a meeting agenda via OpenAI, insert into Google Docs, inform everyone on Slack — in one flow!”

### 🌟 **Schedule & Event Triggers**
Build routines that respond to user actions, app launches, new emails, or pretty much any digital signal your system can emit.  
Example: “When USB drive inserted, scan for new photos, back up to cloud, then safely eject.”

### 🌏 **Internationalization Engine**
Not just translation, but locale awareness: currency formatting, time zones, custom greetings — Blum respects your world!

### 🧠 **Adaptive UI Layer**
No more “one size fits none.” Whether touch, mouse, or keyboard-driven, interfaces flex gracefully, and accessibility is first-tier.

### 🛠️ **Self-Updating Modules**
No need to remember version numbers. Blum fetches core updates quietly and applies them securely with your confirmation. Updates notify you — never disrupt you.
